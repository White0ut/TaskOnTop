TaskOnTop is meant to be a simple TaskManager I threw together in about a day from an old project I had sitting around, I knew I would use it a lot and it fits my needs, looking to expand on it a little once I have more time.

## TODO: 
- Add tabbing through priorities, then add Swipe Views
- Enable notifications based on due dates / possibly incorporate alarms
- Aim to remove the footer view, place it an action bar, or menu button
- Implement Widgets for easy manipulation
